# Falgir

mini project about Fal, the art of iranian divination...
Families and friends get together on the winter equinox to ask for wisdom on the longest night of the year. 
This is done using poetry, I have picked some prose and poetry myself to do the same! 
I want to see what the combinations of the selected omen and poem can inspire about personal questions and wishes.
Hopefully will use it on this year's winter equinox with family and friends :D!

This game implements the concept of poetry and predicition in Iranian culture. For more information about this in concept feel free to read <a href="https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/divination"> here
